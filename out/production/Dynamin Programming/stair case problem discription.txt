this is the discription of the stair case problem

in stair case problem in this case you are given N number of steps to climb and you can do that by climbing only
one step at a time or two step at a time so now the problem is to find the total number of distinct possible ways
in which a person can climb the stairs

in recurve method first if is to check wether there is a solution from dynaic programing already or not
then second else usees recursion it is top to bottom approch

in if else same comcept bu bottom to top approch is uses to check
